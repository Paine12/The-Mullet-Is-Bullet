        <h3>First what is a <span class="highlight">mullet</span> (even tough you should already know what it is)</h3>
        <p><span class="highlight">The mullet</span> is the best type of haircut anyone could have. It is characterised by having the front part short and in the back long (thus the saying "bussiness in the front party in the back"), with the sides short or cut.
            People are used to hating on it because they cant understand the beauty of it. <span class="highlight">THE MULLET</span> IS NOT ONLY A HAIRCUT , IT IS A WAY OF LIVING , AND A BOLD ONE THAT

        <h3>Now seriously why would you make yourself this weird looking cut</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Because YOU Can</li>
            <li>Because it can give you a lot of confidence knowing no one has the BALLS to look as angelic as you</li>
            <li>You can be part of a brotherhood, a mullet brotherhood. When you meet another mulletista you will automatically be friends with each other only because of the haircut</li>
